# BERT for Text Editing and Interpretability

## Overview

This project explores and enhances BERT-based models for text editing tasks, with a focus on understanding how BERT identifies and corrects edits in text. The project implements insights gained from studying Transformers, including "The Illustrated Transformers" and "Attention is All You Need," and thoroughly studying BERT variants such as RoBERTa and SciBERT. Utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch, the project acquires relevant data, conducts NLP-based EDA to analyze linguistic data, and aims to replicate and potentially improve upon results from the paper "Understanding how BERT identifies edits." The approach includes developing a debugging strategy using failure cases to enhance model robustness and employing tools like TensorBoard and Weight and Biases to interpret model weights across different layers of BERT. Future directions may include developing an end-to-end editing web application centered around BERT.

## Implementation

The project follows these steps:

- **Learning and Implementation**: After studying foundational concepts and BERT variants, practical implementation is carried out using the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch.
  
- **Data Acquisition and EDA**: Relevant data is acquired and subjected to NLP-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand its linguistic characteristics.
  
- **Goal**: The primary goal is to replicate and potentially surpass the performance benchmarks set by the paper "Understanding how BERT identifies edits" by exploring new scoring metrics for text editing tasks.
  
- **Debugging and Interpretability**: A strategy for debugging using failure cases is developed to enhance the model's robustness. Tools like TensorBoard and Weight and Biases are used to interpret the role of weights in different layers of the BERT model.
  
- **Continuous Learning**: Continuous learning through additional research and resources ensures ongoing improvement in understanding and implementing advanced NLP techniques with BERT.

## Conclusion

This project aims to deepen understanding and improve the capabilities of BERT and its variants in text editing tasks. By focusing on implementation after learning key concepts and models, the project contributes to the interpretability and effectiveness of BERT models in natural language processing.

Contributions, suggestions for improvement, or collaborations are welcome to further advance BERT-based models in text editing and related tasks.
